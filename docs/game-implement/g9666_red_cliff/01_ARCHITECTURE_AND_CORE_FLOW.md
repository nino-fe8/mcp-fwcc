## 2. Spin Start Sequence & State Reset Pipeline

When a new spin initiates, the following sequential commands execute:
1. **`onBeforeSpinStart`** $\rightarrow$ Locks bet buttons, cancels pending win animations.
2. **`_resetTable`** $\rightarrow$ Emits:
   - `BEFORE_RESET_TABLE`
   - `CLEAR_PAYLINES`
   - `SYNC_TABLE`
   - `RESET_MULTIPLIER` (resets multiplier banner to baseline $\times 1$ in Base Game or active sticky in Free Game)
   - `RESET_SCATTER_COUNT`
3. **Symbol Reversion**: Multiplier Wilds that did not explode in previous cascades reset `hasCollectedMultiplier = false` and re-show their multiplier badge.
