## 2.1 State Machine Specification

```typescript
enum TotalWinState {
    IDLE = 0,               // Uninitialized, inactive
    COUNTING = 1,           // Spine 'in' playing, money count tween running
    COUNTING_COMPLETED = 2, // Spine 'loop' playing, 1.0s debounce & 3.0s auto-close
    CLOSING = 3             // Spine 'out' playing, preparing to resolve callback
}
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> COUNTING: enter() -> playSkeletonAnim('in') & startCountingMoney()
    
    COUNTING --> COUNTING_COMPLETED: Tween finish OR User Tap (skipCounting)
    
    state COUNTING_COMPLETED {
        [*] --> LockTouch_1s: Start 1.0s Debounce Tween
        LockTouch_1s --> AllowClickToClose: 1.0s Elapsed (_canClickToClose = true)
        LockTouch_1s --> AutoClose_3s: Start 3.0s Auto-Close Timer
    }

    COUNTING_COMPLETED --> CLOSING: User Click (after debounce) OR 3.0s Timeout -> closePopup()
    
    state CLOSING {
        [*] --> PlayOutAnim: Spine setAnimation('out')
        PlayOutAnim --> FinishExit: 'out' completeListener fires
        PlayOutAnim --> ImmediateExit: User taps again during 'out'
    }

    CLOSING --> IDLE: exit() -> cleanupTweens() -> fireCutsceneClose()
    CLOSING --> [*]
```

## 2.3 Interactive Touch Rules (`onClick`)

```typescript
public onClick(): void {
    if (this._popupState === TotalWinState.COUNTING) {
        // 1. Skip count-up immediately to target amount
        this.playSoundSkip();
        this.skipCounting();
    } else if (this._popupState === TotalWinState.COUNTING_COMPLETED) {
        // 2. Trigger 'out' transition if 1.0s debounce has elapsed
        if (this._canClickToClose) {
            this.closePopup();
        }
    } else if (this._popupState === TotalWinState.CLOSING) {
        // 3. User taps during 'out' animation -> force instant exit
        this.exit();
    }
}
```
