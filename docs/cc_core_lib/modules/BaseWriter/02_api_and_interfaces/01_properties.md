## 1. Property Schema & Functional Roles

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`game`** | `Game` | Operational field tracking state in `BaseWriter`. |
| **`dataStore`** | `CoreDataStore` | Central reactive state store (`GameDataStore`) containing session data, bet matrices, and server responses. |
| **`name`** | `string` | Operational field tracking state in `BaseWriter`. |
| **`game`** | `Game)` | Operational field tracking state in `BaseWriter`. |
