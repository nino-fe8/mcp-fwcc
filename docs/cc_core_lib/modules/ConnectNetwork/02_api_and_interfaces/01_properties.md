## 1. Property Schema & Functional Roles

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`gameId`** | `string` | Unique game identifier string (e.g. `'9666'`, `'9000'`, `'cc1-red-cliff'`) used for scoped storage and API endpoints. |
| **`mock`** | `any` | Operational field tracking state in `ConnectNetwork`. |
| **`network`** | `any): void` | Operational field tracking state in `ConnectNetwork`. |
