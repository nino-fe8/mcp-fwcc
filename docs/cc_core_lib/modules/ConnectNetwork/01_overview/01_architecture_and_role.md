## 1. Architectural Mission

`ConnectNetwork` is an essential logic component within **`share-lib`**. It encapsulates dedicated business rules, lifecycle hooks, and optimized runtime performance tailored for high-framerate ($60\text{ FPS}$) Cocos Creator 2.4 slot games.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

1. **Deterministic Lifecycle Orchestration**:
   - Manages state machine transitions with zero uncontrolled side-effects.
2. **Memory & Performance Optimization**:
   - Zero-allocation design preventing Garbage Collection (GC) spikes during high-frequency spin loops.
3. **Cross-Platform Resilience**:
   - Normalizes engine quirks between iOS WebAudio, Android touch dispatchers, and desktop WebGL canvas adapters.
